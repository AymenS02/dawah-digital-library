No one dissuades from what is necessitated by this Fitrah (i.e. the belief in Allah), except the one whose heart has been subjected to what averts it from its (natural course of) Fitrah, as the Prophet (peace be upon him) explained when he said: 'Each child is born in a state of Fitrah, but his parents make him a Jew or a Christian.'"

The creatures could not have brought themselves to existence because a thing does not create itself-since prior to its existence it was nothing. So how could it be a Creator? And it cannot accidentally bring itself into being, because every occurrence (novelty, etc.) must need an originator. Also because its existence in such highly magnificent order and homogenous coordination, and due to the coherent relationship between the means and their causes, and the creatures with one another, it is rather absolutely impossible that its very being is coincidental. (In fact), what is (believed) to exist as a result of coincidence does not follow an ordered pattern at the beginning of its existence. So how could it remain to be ordered during its course of survival and development?\n\nSo, if it is impossible that the creatures have either brought themselves into existence or that they came to exist by coincidence, then it becomes evident that they must have a Creator, and He is Allah, the Rabb of the Worlds."

The information about the universe brought forth by the Scriptures and whose manifestation testifies for their truthfulness, is a proof that they came from the (One) Rabb Who is Able to bring into being whatever He already informed about."

This constitutes an unequivocal evidence for the existence of Allah Subhanahu wa Ta'ala.\n\nHe (SWT) says: And (remember) Noah, when he cried (to Us) aforetime. We listened to his invocation. (Qur'an 21:76).\n\nHe Subhanahu wa Ta'ala, also says: (Remember) when you sought help of your Rabb and He answered you. (Qur'an 8:9)."
